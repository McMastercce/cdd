We use Dropbox to share files. The following table lists the files that you will use for integration located in the Dropbox/CCE Development - Templates/6. LST Templates folder. If you have not been added to our Dropbox contact an LST.

               While you can use these files as a starting point to develop webpages, it is reccomended that you <strong>copy all components</strong> from the CCE Template in Avenue to your course using the <a href="https://documentation.brightspace.com/EN/le/course_administration/instructor/copy_course_components.htm" target="_blank">Import/Export/Copy</a> feature. This will ensure that settings are copied and configured correctly in your course.
