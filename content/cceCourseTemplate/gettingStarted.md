## Manage Files

The following table provides a breakdown of the various files and folders in the Manage Files(Course Admin &gt; Manage Files) area of the CCE Course Template.

<table class="table table-bordered table-striped table-sm">
   <caption class="sr-only">
      The first column lists the Folder Name. The second column provides a summary of what is in each folder.
   </caption>
   <thead>
      <tr class="d-flex">
         <th class="col-4" scope="col">Location</th>
         <th class="col-8" scope="col">Purpose</th>
      </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>      
      <tr class="d-flex">
         <td class="col-4">Avenue/code</td>
         <td class="col-8">CSS, javascript and icon code files.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="d-flex">
         <td class="col-4">Avenue/code/css</td>
         <td class="col-8">
            CSS and font icon files.
            <br>
            <div class="spacer-xs-6 spacer-sm-7 spacer-md-8"></div>
            All HTML pages refer to the <strong>main.min.css</strong> for styling. You will also find additional main.min.css(program) files. These are not linked to any HTML files. Based on the course that you are working on, rename the file that you need. For example for a business course I would rename "main.min.css(business)" to "main.min.css".
         </td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="d-flex">
         <td class="col-4">Avenue/toc</td>
         <td class="col-8">Module pages that appear directly in the table of contents are stored here.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr class="d-flex">
         <td class="col-4">Avenue/media</td>
         <td class="col-8">Any additional files in the course such as images, documents or html pages that are hyperlinked from a module are stored here. This includes readings and transcripts.</td>
      </tr>
   </tbody>
